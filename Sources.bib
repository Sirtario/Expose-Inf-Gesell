It highlights the challenges associated with the design of bias-mitigation strategies, and it outlines some best practices suggested by researchers. Finally, a set of guidelines is presented that could aid ML developers in identifying potential sources of bias, as well as avoiding the introduction of unwanted biases. The work is meant to serve as an educational resource for ML developers in handling and addressing issues related to bias in AI systems.},

@article{Jobin,
	abstract = {In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). However, despite an apparent agreement that AI should be `ethical', there is debate about both what constitutes `ethical AI'and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.},

@article{Minkkinen,
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to both a research field and a set of technologies, is rapidly growing and has already spread to application areas ranging from policing to healthcare and transport. The increasing AI capabilities bring novel risks and potential harms to individuals and societies, which auditing of AI seeks to address. However, traditional periodic or cyclical auditing is challenged by the learning and adaptive nature of AI systems. Meanwhile, continuous auditing (CA) has been discussed since the 1980s but has not been explicitly connected to auditing of AI. In this paper, we connect the research on auditing of AI and CA to introduce CA of AI (CAAI). We define CAAI as a (nearly) real-time electronic support system for auditors that continuously and automatically audits an AI system to assess its consistency with relevant norms and standards. We adopt a bottom-up approach and investigate the CAAI tools and methods found in the academic and grey literature. The suitability of tools and methods for CA is assessed based on criteria derived from CA definitions. Our study findings indicate that few existing frameworks are directly suitable for CAAI and that many have limited scope within a particular sector or problem area. Hence, further work on CAAI frameworks is needed, and researchers can draw lessons from existing CA frameworks; however, this requires consideration of the scope of CAAI, the human--machine division of labour, and the emerging institutional landscape in AI governance. Our work also lays the foundation for continued research and practical applications within the field of CAAI.},
